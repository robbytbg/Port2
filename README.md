# Summary Of the Project(EN)

1. Machine Learning
   
Data loading, preprocessing, SVM model training, 3D visualization, performance assessment, and predictive analysis were all integrated together in a fluid manner in my project. A comprehensive understanding of the model's capabilities and possibilities for handling additional data points was provided by the use of 3D scatter plots in conjunction with strong evaluation measures.

2. Data Visualization

This Power BI project on chartered bicycles will thoroughly examine utilization trends and relevant variables. Visualizations give a clear picture of patterns, seasonal demand, and the effects of variables like wind speed, temperature, and humidity. Examples of these visualizations include clustered line and column charts, color-coded bar charts, funnel charts, pie charts, and humidity bins graphics. The interactive dashboard provides in-depth insights into the dynamics of chartered bicycle usage, encouraging exploration.

3.Data Cleaning

I carefully selected and improved the dataset for this FIFA21 data cleaning job to guarantee its accuracy and consistency. The procedure included managing missing values, removing unneeded columns strategically, and making formatting changes for better readability. In order to increase readability, columns were rearranged and player status indicators were added. Numerical consistency was guaranteed by unit standardization, money value conversion, and symbol removal. The 'Positions' column was cleaned and sorted alphabetically to better improve the dataset. The result is a refined dataset that can be stored as "cleaned fifa21.csv" and is prepared for more efficient modeling and analysis with better data integrity.

4. Data Engineering(ETL)

I converted crowdfunding data in an efficient manner for my ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) project by dividing up the category data, creating unique identifiers, and then combining them back into the original dataset. After being cleaned, formatted, and improved, the data was put into a CSV file and saved. In parallel, I created columns labeled "first_name" and "last_name" after extracting and organizing JSON data. Another CSV file had the arranged contact info. In addition, I created a MySQL database with SQL commands by utilizing a given schema. Thorough testing guaranteed the integrity of the database and the successful recovery of data. This ETL project includes thorough data organization, integration, and refining for upcoming analysis.

5. Explanatory Data Analysis(EDA)
   
This comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) investigation of global population data proceeded methodically through key phases. I built a strong analytical foundation by carefully exploring the dataset before moving on to loading, descriptive statistics, and correlation analysis. The data was thoughtfully sorted and shown to highlight the top nations and provide detailed insights into demographic changes. An in-depth analysis of particular nations, like Indonesia, offered a window into regional patterns. Global view was expanded with continent-wise analysis that included mean population trends and dispersion representations. A visually stunning pie chart that showed the world population distribution per continent in 2022 was displayed in the finale. This extensive EDA produced a deep and insightful investigation of global population changes by skillfully fusing statistical depth with eye-catching images.
